          The data in these graphs represents the daily recorded deaths from
          COVID-19, per country.<br />

          These graphs can be altered using the slider on the right.<br />
          The line represents an average of between 2 and 50 days data.<br />

          By increasing the averaging sample size, we can more clearly identify
          the historic trends in the data.

        This series of graphs has been produced to demonstrate some data
        visualisation techniques with d3.js.<br />
        The respective data have been scaled such that the shape of the graphs
        are similar. <br />
        ie: the scales are different with respect to each country's available
        data.<br />
        As such it is important to note that while the trends are easily
        visible, the rate<br />
        of change at any one point is not necessarily given fairly by the
        gradient of the line.<br />
        For example, Iran's data shows a dramatic increase towards the end of
        the dataset, but given <br />
        that the absolute numbers are so much smaller than, for example, the US,
        the increase would <br />
        well explained by only a small % deviation within the numbers.<br />
        <br />
        The data is sourced from www.ecdc.europa.eu. <br />
        I have made quite a few graphs from live json API's but as I don't
        monitor the source regularly, I have chosen to use a static csv file for
        this visualisation. <br />
        Thanks for taking a look at these examples.<br />
        I am currently updating a new portfolio site with more complex work in
        Python, which I am hoping to integrate with d3.js for visualising
        distributions etc..<br />
