SITE WIDE: 

Go over containers. bootstrap uses the container class for it's flexbox wrapper, hence why I don;t always see it.
Re orgainse Project landing pages to use flex box or grid, via boot strap so I get the resizing on mobile.

Revisit the navbar to chekc it resizes correctly on mobile. Maybe use flex box and separate the nav and the content on the front page into two separate rows.
Eventually: 
Left Nav ||  Content || right space (to fill in future with links? embed codepen + insta?)

ARTWORK SECTION:

It can be a straight up gallery possibly, that clicks through to a live version, with refresh on click.

DATA VIZ:

Make sample projects.

make one - using Jstat. review the python stuff, make some predictions/models

make another, using a bit of jupyter? see if it can be embedded

make some chloropleth thing

make stuff with scaled svgs, like pencil sales made of pencils.... weather data with weather icons

make a few pages that walk through a process.>
	>load data
	>assess
	>remove outliers
	>go back over the old python thing.

make some snazzy ones. animated hierarchies etc.

aNIMATION:

SPLIT INTO INTERACTIVE / NON INTERACTIVE

bubble popper: needs a back ground, or loading something

cells : the colour jumping badly occurs every other time. what gan on?

main menu is shit. make something new.

mini ideas is similarly whack.

iNSTAGRAM snippet:

<div id="pixlee_container"></div><script type="text/javascript">window.PixleeAsyncInit = function() {Pixlee.init({apiKey:'TeGljebynC4-eJ6JD8oO'});Pixlee.addSimpleWidget({widgetId:'30513'});};</script><script src="//instafeed.assets.pxlecdn.com/assets/pixlee_widget_1_0_0.js"></script>
bin that,
 <!-- SnapWidget -->

bin that also. Maybe do this myself and just drop good files fo the things I like most in a gallery that can be scrolled through / random.
