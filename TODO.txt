SITE WIDE: 

rework artwork/animations into one page, using ethe blog/card style.

ARTWORK SECTION:

It can be a straight up gallery possibly, that clicks through to a live version, with refresh on click.

DATA VIZ:

Make sample projects.

make one - using Jstat. review the python stuff, make some predictions/models

make another, using a bit of jupyter? see if it can be embedded

make some chloropleth thing

make stuff with scaled svgs, like pencil sales made of pencils.... weather data with weather icons

make a few pages that walk through a process.>
	>load data
	>assess
	>remove outliers
	>go back over the old python thing.

make some snazzy ones. animated hierarchies etc.

aNIMATION:

SPLIT INTO INTERACTIVE / NON INTERACTIVE

bubble popper: needs a back ground, or loading something

cells : the colour jumping badly occurs every other time. what gan on?

main menu is shit. make something new.

mini ideas is similarly whack.

iNSTAGRAM snippet:

<div id="pixlee_container"></div><script type="text/javascript">window.PixleeAsyncInit = function() {Pixlee.init({apiKey:'TeGljebynC4-eJ6JD8oO'});Pixlee.addSimpleWidget({widgetId:'30513'});};</script><script src="//instafeed.assets.pxlecdn.com/assets/pixlee_widget_1_0_0.js"></script>
